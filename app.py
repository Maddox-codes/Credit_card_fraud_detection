st.markdown("""
This application simulates a scenario where you manually input transaction details for a prediction. In a real-world setting, fraud detection systems are fully automated and operate in real-time. Here's how they typically work:

* **Real-time Processing:** Transactions are analyzed instantly as they occur, without manual data entry.
* **Message Queues:** High-volume systems use message queues (like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ) to handle the massive stream of incoming transactions reliably.
* **Low-Latency Models:** The machine learning models are highly optimized for speed to provide decisions in milliseconds.
* **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously improves. When a transaction is flagged and a customer confirms it was legitimate (or vice-versa), this feedback is used to retrain and fine-tune the model, making it more accurate over time.
* **Automated Actions:** Based on the real-time prediction, the system can trigger alerts to a fraud analyst or take immediate action, such as temporarily blocking the transaction and notifying the customer.
