In a real-world setting, fraud detection systems are fully automated and operate in milliseconds. Here's a simplified overview:
* **Real-time Processing:** Transactions are analyzed instantly as they occur.
* **Automated Feature Engineering:** The system automatically generates features (like spending frequency, location changes, etc.) from raw transaction data.
* **Low-Latency Models:** The machine learning models are highly optimized for speed to provide decisions in real-time.
* **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously learns. When a transaction is confirmed as fraud (or not), this feedback is used to retrain and improve the model.
